# SIEM-Implementation-in-Azure-Cloud

Our foremost objective is to initiate the creation and deployment of Microsoft SIEM in the Azure Cloud, aiming to enhance cybersecurity by leveraging advanced threat detection capabilities and customized configurations. We've diligently executed the deployment of Microsoft Sentinel and integrated sophisticated methods, such as custom KQL (Kusto Query Language) analytics rules, to strengthen our defenses against emerging threats.

This project is centered around conducting thorough incident investigations and promptly executing remedial measures to minimize the impact of cybersecurity threats, effectively managing risks, and preventing potential reoccurrences. Our focus remains on safeguarding the integrity and robustness of your Azure-based infrastructure.
